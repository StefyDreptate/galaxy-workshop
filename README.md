# Galaxy Training Course: Content Library & Events

**TODO** This will be rewritten, it is a work in progress.

This is a template repository to easily create a course website for your Galaxy Training

This template is based on the ones used for the [GTN Smorgasbord event]() in February 2021,
and the training week preceding the [Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)]()

This repository enables you to easily configure a course handbook (website) like this for
your own workshop, and serve it using GitHub pages. To see the live version of this template repo, please see [here](https://gallantries.github.io/galaxy-workshop/).
