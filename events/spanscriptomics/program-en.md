    post-course:
      title: "After the Course"
      description: |
        We'll send you a survey after the course - PLEASE fill it out, as this is crucial for the GTÑ study on the impact of translating bioinformatics materials.
        All the course materials will remain online, so you can continue working on them for as
        long as you want. The only difference will be that you should ask your questions
        on the <a href="https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby">GTN Gitter channel</a>, instead of Slack.

        title: "Quieres cambiar idioma?"
        description: |
          Here you can switch to the programmes with resources that were automatically translated (CAT-Español) or translated by humans (HES-Español). Please remember to note this in the post-course survey! This is valuable data!
