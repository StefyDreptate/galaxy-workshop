![Gallantries logo](https://gallantries.github.io/assets/images/gallantries-logo-inverted.svg){: style="float: right" width="200px"}


This is a work in progress but we expect to provide here two things:

1. A library of training materials (GTN materials + videos + captions)
2. A platform for hosting asynchronous events based on these materials.

More information in the future.
